    "- Reinforcement Learning: The example data consists of both inputs and outputs. Compare to SL, RL typically deals with temporal data so the output may only be an evaluation at the current point in time and may not be reflective of the overall outcome. In RL the feedback given is different from the \"output\" which is an action the agent needs to take.\n"

Because housing price is continous, this is a regression problem. It can be very easy to re-frame this as a classification problem if the aim was to classify the neighborhood as cheap or expensive with a defined cut-off between cheap and expensive based on median home value."

The output is the one of 3 species of iris: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. Since the output is categorical this is a classfication problem. And to solve the problem we want to create a model that is a function that will map an arbitrary point in the 4-dimensional input space to to a label of the species of iris.\n",

Different algorithms make various assumptions on how patterns in the input-space should influence the mapping to outputs. This notebook provides some example code on training a variety of models and doing a rudimentary comparison of metrics based on using different hyper-parameters to configure the algorithm. \n",
